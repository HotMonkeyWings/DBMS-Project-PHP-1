<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/kay-23/DBMS-Project-PHP)

Colleges and most private schools have in-campus hostels. Most possess an improper method of storing and managing their inmates’ data. Moreover, these institutions impose a curfew on the female students residing in their hostels. The rule has, therefore, led to the initiation of permissions. Thus, female students need to attain permissions to leave hostel premises during weekends, obtain approval for escorting first-year girls to on-campus events and for extension of curfew times for girls in cultural or sports teams.

The current system to get permission for leave in the LH requires students to manually submit their applications to the RT well in advance. Later, it is verified with a message from the parent. Finally, the permission is approved by the Warden. Also, copies of the same have to be submitted in the LH Office and LH gate before being permitted to leave. Permissions for fests or on any other occasion, which requires the inmate to stay out of the hostel for an extended time, requires a similar procedure.

The above system is not hassle-free and creates a miserable hostel life for many inmates. Hence, it has led to an increase in the number of individuals who have moved into rented apartments over the past years.

Implementation of a DBMS would contribute greatly to making inmates’ lives easier.
